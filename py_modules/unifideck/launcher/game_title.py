"""Resolve a human game title for launcher toasts.

py_modules/unifideck/launcher/game_title.py

Launcher toasts had nothing better to show than the raw launch key, so a
Battle.net toast read *"Starting battlenet:D1 through Battle.net…"* and a
Ubisoft one named a bare UUID. ``games.map`` cannot help — its rows are
``store:game_id = exe \\t work_dir \\t app_id`` with no title column — but
``shortcuts_registry.json`` records one per shortcut, because the reconcile
pass needs it to name the Steam entry.

Read-only, stdlib-only, and never raises: this runs in the out-of-process
launcher under the SYSTEM python (3.10-3.14), and a missing or malformed
registry must degrade to "no nicer title available" rather than break a
launch that is otherwise fine.
